- Atomics operations are the main building block for anything involvong multiple threads. Mutex and Condvar implemented using it. Atomics operation are available as methods on the standard atomics types std::sync::atomic like AtomicI32 or AtomicUsize.
- Memory ordering - is a mode of operation of atomics. It defines how the atomic operation interacts with other threads. There are 6 memory ordering modes:
  - Relaxed - no ordering guarantees
  - Release - all previous writes are visible to other threads
  - Acquire - all subsequent reads are visible to other threads
  - AcqRel - both Release and Acquire
  - SeqCst - all operations are visible to other threads in the order they were performed
  - Consume - only subsequent reads that depend on the current value are visible to other threads
- Atomic operations: load and store (store takes shared reference of self, but it actually modify)
- thread scope joins all threads on drop
- Using lazy initialization of static Atomic variable with more then 1 thread could cause a race. Could be solved by std::sync::Once or OnceLock
- fetch_* - atomic operations that return old value, but not always the same as load, so it is unreliable. fetch_add and fetch_sub won't panic on overflow, instead return max or min.
