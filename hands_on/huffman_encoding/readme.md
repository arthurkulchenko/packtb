The Huffman algorithm is a popular technique in computer science for lossless data compression and decompression. Named after its inventor, David Huffman, this algorithm constructs a variable-length prefix code that efficiently encodes each symbol of a given alphabet. Symbols that appear more frequently are assigned shorter codes, while less frequent symbols are assigned longer codes. Huffman coding is widely used in applications such as ZIP file compression, JPEG image compression, and in the field of telecommunications.
How Huffman Coding Works
Step 1: Frequency Table

Firstly, the frequency of each symbol in the dataset (often a text file) is calculated.

For example, for the string "ABRACADABRA", the frequency table would be:

    A: 5
    B: 2
    R: 2
    C: 1
    D: 1

Step 2: Create a Priority Queue

Create a priority queue (often a min-heap) and insert all symbols of the dataset into the queue. The priority is determined by the frequency of each symbol. In this example, the queue will start with:

    A: 5
    B: 2
    R: 2
    C: 1
    D: 1

Step 3: Build the Huffman Tree

    While there is more than one node in the queue:
        Remove the two nodes with the lowest frequency from the queue.
        Create a new internal node with these two nodes as children. The frequency of this internal node is the sum of the frequencies of the two children.
        Insert the new internal node back into the queue.

Repeat the process until there is only one node left in the queue. This node is the root of the Huffman tree.
Step 4: Generate Codes

Starting from the root, traverse the tree to generate the Huffman codes:

    Going left is usually represented by '0'.
    Going right is usually represented by '1'.

For example, if A has a code of '0', B might have a code of '101', etc.
Step 5: Encode the Data

Replace each symbol in the original data with its Huffman code. The resulting string of bits is the compressed data.
Step 6: Decode the Data (Decompression)

To decompress, you'll start from the root of the Huffman tree and use each bit in the compressed data to traverse the tree. When you reach a leaf node, you'll append the symbol associated with that leaf node to your output string and restart the traversal from the root.
Advantages and Disadvantages
Advantages

    Efficient compression for data with varying symbol frequencies.
    Lossless compression: original data can be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data.

Disadvantages

    Requires the entire Huffman tree to decode the compressed data, which means the tree must either be sent with the data or reconstructed.
    Less effective for data with uniformly distributed symbol frequencies.

That's the basic idea behind Huffman coding. It can get more complex in real-world applications, but this should give you a good foundation.
